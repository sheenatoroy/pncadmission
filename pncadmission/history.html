            <p>In <b>2003</b> Pamantasan ng Cabuyao (PnC) was established through Municipal Ordinance No. 2003-059, “Ordinance Establishing the Pamantasan ng Cabuyao (University of Cabuyao) and Other Purposes” which was signed on April 16, 2003 by then Municipal Mayor Proceso D. Aguillo. In June 2003, the university started its operation – offering courses in midwifery, nursing, teacher education, business administration, and information technology.</p>
        
        <hr class="separator"/>

            <p>In <b>2016</b> Under the new leadership of Mayor Rommel A. Gecolea in 2016, educational and institutional reforms were introduced to the university. Serious efforts were exerted to level up the academic standards of the university as well as to improve its administration and governance. More importantly, Mayor Rommel Gecolea through the City Council, increased the city subsidy to the university from six (6) percent to twelve (12) percent.</p>

        <hr class="separator"/>

            <p>In <b>2017</b> The university received its Commission on Higher Education (CHED) Institutional Recognition, becoming one of the 17 local colleges and universities (LCUs) from 112 LCUs to receive such recognition. </p>

        <hr class="separator"/>

            <p>In <b>2018</b> The university received its Association of Local Colleges and Universities Commission on Accreditation (ALCU-COA) Level 1 Accreditation Status, becoming of the few LCUs in the country with accredited academic programs. </p>

        <hr class="separator"/>

            <p>In <b>2019</b> The university was awarded by the Duterte Administration the right to avail of the FREE COLLEGE EDUCATION or the Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education (UNIFAST) under the Republic Act 10931 – becoming one of the 76 LCUs in the country to be given such right to free education. Under such law, the university will be given national subsidy through CHED equivalent to the amount of the total student collection per semester. </p>

        <hr class="separator"/>

            <p>In <b>Present</b> At its current state, the university has already been benchmarked by more than twenty-seven (27) LCUs across the country and has been looked upon as model LCU by LGUs aspiring to set-up their own LCU. Over the years, PnC has provided advisory services to a number of LCUs and LGUs in areas of administration and governance, quality instruction, student services, research and extension, arts and culture, and academe-industry relations.</p>
